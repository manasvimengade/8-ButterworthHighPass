# 8-ButterworthHighPass
This script applies a Butterworth high-pass filter to enhance edges by removing low-frequency components. It transforms the image to the frequency domain using FFT, applies the filter, and converts it back using inverse FFT. The result is a sharpened image with enhanced details.
